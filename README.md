# Hit Counter exercise

Your mission is to add a working hit counter to the homepage, by using `database.json` as the source of truth.

## Running a development server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, start a local development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

**Note:** Unlike create-react-app, we need to run the `dev` command, not `start`. The `start` command is used to run a _production_ server; we'll learn more about that later in the course.
